The final university project from the "Java Programming" course, designed with the aim of creating a user interface application for tracking and sharing hiking routes. This application enables users to add routes along with descriptive images to highlight the most interesting parts of each route. It is implemented in Java and JavaFX, utilizing a local SQLite database for efficient data storage.
